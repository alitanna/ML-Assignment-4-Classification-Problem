**Breast Cancer Classification**

Objective:
The objective of this assessment is to evaluate the understanding and ability to apply supervised learning techniques to a real-world dataset.

Dataset
The dataset used is the Breast Cancer dataset available in the sklearn library. It consists of 30 continuous features representing cell nuclei characteristics, with a target variable indicating whether a tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0).

Key Components
1. Loading and Preprocessing
Loading the Dataset:

Used load_breast_cancer() from sklearn.datasets to load the dataset.

Handling Missing Values:

Verified that there are no missing values using isnull().sum().

Feature Scaling:

Applied StandardScaler to normalize the dataset, ensuring uniform feature ranges to improve model performance.

Justification: Feature scaling is essential for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, and k-NN). This step enhances convergence and prevents dominant features from skewing the model.

2. Classification Algorithm Implementation
Implemented five classification algorithms:

Logistic Regression:

Linear model estimating probabilities using the sigmoid function.

Suitable for this dataset due to its simplicity and efficiency in binary classification tasks.

Decision Tree Classifier:

Splits data based on feature thresholds in a tree-like structure.

Useful for capturing complex patterns and provides interpretability.

Random Forest Classifier:

An ensemble of decision trees reducing overfitting by averaging predictions.

Suitable for handling large datasets and improving generalization.

Support Vector Machine (SVM):

Finds the optimal hyperplane that maximizes class separation.

Effective for high-dimensional data and robust against overfitting.

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):

Classifies points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors.

Works well on smaller datasets but can be computationally expensive for large ones.

3. Model Comparison
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

Visualized the accuracy comparison using a bar chart.

Best Performing Model: Based on the accuracy metric, the best model is identified after evaluation.

Worst Performing Model: The model with the lowest accuracy is also highlighted.
